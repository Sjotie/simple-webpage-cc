# Railway Deployment Process Log

## Objective
Deploy a simple Node.js/Express webpage to Railway and document the process for training the deployment engineer.

## Environment
- User: sjoerd.tiem@gmail.com (already logged in)
- Working Directory: C:\Users\sjoer\OneDrive\Bureaublad\AI\CC
- Platform: Windows (win32)

## Application Structure
- `index.html` - Main webpage
- `styles.css` - CSS styling
- `script.js` - Client-side JavaScript
- `server.js` - Express server
- `package.json` - Node.js configuration
- `railway.json` - Railway configuration (created by deployment engineer)

## Deployment Attempts

### Attempt 1: Check Railway Status
```bash
railway status
```
**Result**: Error - "No linked project found. Run railway link to connect to a project"

### Attempt 2: Initialize New Project
```bash
railway init
```
**Result**: Interactive prompt appears:
```
? Select a workspace  
> sjotie's Projects
  Sjoerd Tiemensma
[↑↓ to move, enter to select, type to filter]
```
**Issue**: Cannot handle interactive prompts through Bash tool. Times out after 2 minutes.

### Attempt 3: Initialize with Name Flag
```bash
railway init --name simple-webpage
```
**Result**: Same interactive prompt for workspace selection
**Issue**: Even with --name flag, still requires interactive workspace selection

## Key Issues Identified

1. **Interactive Prompts**: Railway CLI requires interactive input for workspace selection that cannot be automated through the Bash tool
2. **Timeout Duration**: The 2-minute timeout is too long when we know an operation will fail due to interactive requirements
3. **No Non-Interactive Mode**: Railway CLI doesn't appear to have flags to bypass interactive prompts for workspace selection

## Potential Solutions

1. **Use Railway Dashboard**: Create project through web interface first, then link with project ID
2. **Environment Variables**: Check if Railway supports environment variables to set default workspace
3. **Railway API**: Use Railway's API directly instead of CLI for non-interactive deployment
4. **Pre-configured Project**: Have a project already created and use `railway link <project-id>`

## Next Steps
- Investigate Railway CLI documentation for non-interactive options
- Try using `railway link` with an existing project ID
- Explore Railway API as alternative to CLI

## Additional Findings

### Timeout Configuration
- The Bash tool accepts a `timeout` parameter in milliseconds (max 600000ms/10 minutes)
- Set timeout to 10000ms (10 seconds) for faster failure detection

### List Projects Success
```bash
railway list
```
**Result**: Successfully listed all projects under both workspaces:
- sjotie's Projects (5 projects)
- Sjoerd Tiemensma (44 projects)

### Observations
1. User has two workspaces: "sjotie's Projects" and "Sjoerd Tiemensma"
2. Many existing projects available - could potentially reuse one
3. No project IDs shown in list output - need another way to get project ID

### Additional Attempts

#### Open Dashboard
```bash
railway open
```
**Result**: Error - "This command is only available in interactive mode"

#### Check Railway Version
```bash
railway --version
```
**Result**: railway 4.5.5

## Workaround Approaches

### Option 1: Manual Project Creation
Since Railway CLI requires interactive input for project creation, the recommended approach is:

1. **Create project via Railway Dashboard**:
   - Visit https://railway.app/new
   - Click "Empty Project"
   - Copy the project ID from the URL or settings
   
2. **Link project locally**:
   ```bash
   railway link --project <project-id>
   ```

3. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   railway up
   ```

### Option 2: GitHub Integration
1. Push code to GitHub repository
2. Connect GitHub repo to Railway via dashboard
3. Automatic deployment on push

### Current Blockers
- Railway CLI v4.5.5 doesn't support non-interactive project creation
- Workspace selection always requires interactive prompt
- No environment variables available to set default workspace
- `railway open` command only works in interactive mode
